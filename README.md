# Risk and Returns The Sharpe Ratio

Project description

Sharpe Ratio was developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe and measures the relationship between Return / Volatility of an investment fund. It is calculated by dividing the profitability of a fund minus the risk-free interest rate. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the return of the fund in relation to the amount of risk that has been taken in the investment. The greater the volatility, the greater the risk, since the chances of that fund having negative returns are greater the greater the volatility of its returns. Likewise, the greater the volatility, the greater the probability of high positive returns. Therefore, when the volatility of the fund is high, the higher the denominator of the equation and the lower the Sharpe Ratio.

In this project we will see the application of the Sharpe Ratio using financial data from two very important stocks and using the S&P 500 as a reference with the help of the Pandas library.
